New YAML Grammar
================

A redesign of the YAML grammar

# Background

The YAML 1.2 grammar exists inside this web page https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2770814

# Goals

* Simple to read and understand
* Well documented
* Encoded in YAML (and JSON)
* Easy to generate parsers from


# Style rules

* Rule names are 2-3 lowercase words separated by a dash
* Terminal rules are a single lowercase word
